Config:
    the jar files must be in the correct dir. see pyB.py Line 7-13
    This hard-codes path must be set manually at the moment

Run pyB:
    python pyB.py <FileName>
    e.g Filename or input.txt with the content like: "#PREDICATE 4-3=1" 

Run Tests:
    py.test
    the tests are in the tests folder

Features:
    Evals arith. Preds like:   1+1=2
    Evals set Preds like:   x:ID 
    Evals set extentions like:  {a,b,c}
    Evals quantified preds like: #(z).(z<4 & z>0)
    (variables must been given hard-code-values at the moment)

How it works:
    A AST visitor "ASTPython.java" gens a String with pythoncode.
    This string is executed with "exec" in "pyB.py".
    The string is mapped to the ASTNodes in "ast_nodes.py"
    This AST is eval. via "interp.py"

DONE:
    - replace depricated set module

TODO:
    - implement AST Gen for Node with more than two children
        e.g. ASetExtensionExpression
    - write more AST-Gen tests
